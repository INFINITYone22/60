# Project Title: Basic Calculator

## Description
This project performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to take user input in Python.
- Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Implement conditional statements.
- Handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero).

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of arithmetic operations.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the basic calculator in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Follow the prompts to enter the desired operation and numbers.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- It takes user input for the operation choice and two numbers.
- It uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to perform the selected operation.
- It handles the case of division by zero by returning an error message.

## Extensions
- Add more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Add error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).
