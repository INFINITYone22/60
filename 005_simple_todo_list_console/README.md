# Project Title: Simple To-Do List (Console)

## Description
This project is a simple to-do list application that runs in the console. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks from a list.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use lists in Python.
- Learn how to create a menu-driven program.
- Implement functions to perform specific tasks.
- Take user input and process it accordingly.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of lists, functions, and loops.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the to-do list application in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Follow the menu prompts to add, view, or remove tasks.

## Code Explanation
- The program uses a list to store the tasks.
- It defines functions for displaying the menu, adding a task, viewing tasks, and removing a task.
- It uses a `while` loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
- It uses conditional statements to execute the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
- It includes error handling for invalid input.

## Extensions
- Save the tasks to a file so they are not lost when the program exits.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Add features like prioritizing tasks or setting due dates.
