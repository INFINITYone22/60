# Project Title: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Description
This project generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms specified by the user.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define functions in Python.
- Learn how to use lists in Python.
- Implement a `while` loop to generate the sequence.
- Take user input and process it accordingly.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of lists, functions, and loops.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the Fibonacci sequence generator in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter the desired number of terms when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `fibonacci_sequence(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input.
- It initializes a list `list_fib` with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
- It uses a `while` loop to generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers until the list has `n` terms.
- It appends the next Fibonacci number to the list by adding the last two numbers in the list.
- It returns the list of Fibonacci numbers.

## Extensions
- Implement the Fibonacci sequence generator using recursion.
- Add error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).
- Display the Fibonacci sequence in a more user-friendly format.
