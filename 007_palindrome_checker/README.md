# Project Title: Palindrome Checker

## Description
This project checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome, ignoring spaces and case.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define functions in Python.
- Learn how to manipulate strings in Python.
- Implement conditional statements.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of strings and functions.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the palindrome checker in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter a word or phrase when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `is_palindrome(text)` that takes a string as input.
- It processes the text by converting it to lowercase and removing spaces.
- It checks if the processed text is equal to its reverse.
- It returns `True` if the text is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

## Extensions
- Handle punctuation and other special characters.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Check if a sentence is a palindrome, ignoring word order.
