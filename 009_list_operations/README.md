# Project Title: List Operations (Max, Min, Average)

## Description
This project calculates the maximum, minimum, and average of a list of numbers provided by the user.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define functions in Python.
- Learn how to use lists in Python.
- Use built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, and `sum()`.
- Handle empty lists.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of lists and functions.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the list operations in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `list_operations(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers as input.
- It uses the `max()` function to find the maximum number in the list.
- It uses the `min()` function to find the minimum number in the list.
- It uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list.
- It calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the list.
- It handles the case of an empty list by returning `None` for all three values.

## Extensions
- Add error handling for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).
- Calculate other statistics, such as the median or standard deviation.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
