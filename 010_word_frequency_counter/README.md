# Project Title: Word Frequency Counter

## Description
This project counts the occurrences of each word in a sentence provided by the user.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define functions in Python.
- Learn how to use dictionaries in Python.
- Learn how to manipulate strings in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of strings, dictionaries, and functions.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the word frequency counter in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter a sentence when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `word_frequency_counter(sentence)` that takes a string as input.
- It converts the sentence to lowercase and splits it into a list of words.
- It uses a dictionary to store the word counts.
- It iterates over the words in the list and updates the counts in the dictionary.
- It prints the word counts.

## Extensions
- Ignore punctuation and special characters.
- Sort the word counts by frequency.
- Read the sentence from a file.
