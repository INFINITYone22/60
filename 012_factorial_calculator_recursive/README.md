# Project Title: Factorial Calculator (Recursive)

## Description
This project calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define recursive functions in Python.
- Learn how to use conditional statements.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of numbers, functions, and recursion.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the factorial calculator in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter a number when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `factorial(n)` that takes an integer as input.
- If n is 0, it returns 1 (base case).
- Otherwise, it returns n multiplied by the factorial of n-1 (recursive step).

## Extensions
- Add error handling for invalid input (e.g., negative numbers).
- Implement the factorial calculator without recursion.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
