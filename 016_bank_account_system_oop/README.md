# Project Title: Bank Account System (OOP)

## Description
This project creates a class-based system for managing bank accounts, allowing deposits and withdrawals.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define classes and objects in Python.
- Learn how to implement methods for class objects.
- Implement basic object-oriented programming principles.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of classes, objects, and methods.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the bank account system in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a class `BankAccount` with attributes for account number, account holder, and balance.
- It implements methods for depositing, withdrawing, and getting the balance.
- It creates an instance of the `BankAccount` class and performs operations on it.

## Extensions
- Add more features, such as interest calculation or transaction history.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Add error handling for invalid account numbers or other input.
