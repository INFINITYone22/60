# Project Title: Shape Area Calculator (Inheritance)

## Description
This project uses inheritance to calculate the areas of different shapes, such as circles and rectangles.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define classes and objects in Python.
- Learn how to use inheritance to create subclasses.
- Implement polymorphism through method overriding.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the shape area calculator in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a base class `Shape` with a method `area()`.
- It defines subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape`.
- Each subclass overrides the `area()` method to calculate the area of the specific shape.
- It creates instances of the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes and calls their `area()` methods.

## Extensions
- Add more shapes, such as triangles or squares.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Add error handling for invalid input.
