# Project Title: Animal Sounds (Polymorphism)

## Description
This project demonstrates polymorphism with animal classes, where each animal makes a different sound.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define classes and objects in Python.
- Learn how to use inheritance to create subclasses.
- Implement polymorphism through method overriding.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the animal sounds program in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a base class `Animal` with a method `sound()`.
- It defines subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow` that inherit from `Animal`.
- Each subclass overrides the `sound()` method to return the specific sound of the animal.
- The `animal_sound()` function takes an `Animal` object as input and calls its `sound()` method, demonstrating polymorphism.

## Extensions
- Add more animals and their sounds.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to choose an animal and hear its sound.
