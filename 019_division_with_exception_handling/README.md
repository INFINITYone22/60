# Project Title: Division with Exception Handling

## Description
This project handles division errors, such as division by zero and invalid input.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use try-except blocks in Python.
- Learn how to handle different types of exceptions.
- Implement error handling for division operations.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of exception handling and arithmetic operations.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the division program in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter the two numbers when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `divide(x, y)` that takes two numbers as input.
- It uses a `try-except` block to handle potential errors.
- It handles `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.
- It handles `TypeError` if the input is not a number.

## Extensions
- Add error handling for other types of exceptions.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to choose the numbers from a file.
