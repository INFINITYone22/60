# Project Title: Timing Code Execution (Context Manager)

## Description
This project uses a context manager to time the execution of a code block.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define classes and objects in Python.
- Learn how to use context managers with the `with` statement.
- Implement the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods for context managers.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of classes, objects, and context managers.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the timing code execution in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a class `Timer` that acts as a context manager.
- The `__enter__` method records the start time.
- The `__exit__` method records the end time and calculates the interval.
- The `with` statement automatically calls the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.

## Extensions
- Add more features, such as logging the time to a file.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the code to be timed.
