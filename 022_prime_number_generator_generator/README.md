# Project Title: Prime Number Generator (Generator)

## Description
This project generates prime numbers up to a given limit using a generator function.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to define functions in Python.
- Learn how to use generator functions with the `yield` keyword.
- Implement lazy evaluation for generating prime numbers.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of functions, generators, and prime numbers.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the prime number generator in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter the limit when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program defines a function `prime_generator(limit)` that generates prime numbers up to the limit.
- It uses the `yield` keyword to return each prime number one at a time.
- The `is_prime(number)` function checks if a number is prime.
- The program iterates over the prime numbers generated by the `prime_generator` function and prints them.

## Extensions
- Optimize the prime number generator for larger limits.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the range of prime numbers to generate.
