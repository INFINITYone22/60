# Project Title: Date and Time Utilities

## Description
This project demonstrates how to work with the `datetime` module for date and time operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `datetime` module in Python.
- Learn how to get the current date and time.
- Perform date and time calculations.
- Convert strings to dates and times.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of the `datetime` module.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the date and time utilities in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter your birthdate when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `datetime` module.
- It gets the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
- It gets today's date using `datetime.date.today()`.
- It calculates yesterday's and tomorrow's dates using `datetime.timedelta()`.
- It converts a string to a date using `datetime.datetime.strptime()`.
- It calculates the user's age based on their birthdate.

## Extensions
- Add more date and time operations, such as formatting dates or calculating the time difference between two dates.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to perform different date and time calculations.
