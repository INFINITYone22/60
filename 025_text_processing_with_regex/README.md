# Project Title: Text Processing with Regex

## Description
This project uses regular expressions to extract patterns from text.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `re` module in Python.
- Learn how to write regular expressions to match different patterns.
- Implement text processing using regular expressions.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of regular expressions and the `re` module.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the text processing with regex in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Enter some text when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `re` module.
- It defines a function `text_processing_with_regex(text)` that takes text as input.
- It uses `re.findall()` to find all email addresses, phone numbers, and words starting with 'a' in the text.
- It prints the extracted patterns to the console.

## Extensions
- Add more regular expressions to extract different patterns.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the regular expressions to use.
