# Project Title: Simple GUI with Tkinter

## Description
This project builds a basic GUI application using Tkinter.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `tkinter` module in Python.
- Learn how to create a main window, labels, and buttons.
- Implement event handling for button clicks.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of the `tkinter` module.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the simple GUI in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `tkinter` module as `tk`.
- It creates the main window using `tk.Tk()`.
- It sets the title and geometry of the window.
- It creates a label using `tk.Label()` and adds it to the window using `label.pack()`.
- It creates a button using `tk.Button()` and adds it to the window using `button.pack()`.
- The `button_clicked()` function is called when the button is clicked.
- The `window.mainloop()` starts the main event loop.

## Extensions
- Add more widgets, such as text boxes or check boxes.
- Implement more complex event handling.
- Create a more sophisticated GUI application.
