# Project Title: Advanced List Comprehensions

## Description
This project solves a problem using complex list comprehensions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use list comprehensions in Python.
- Learn how to write complex list comprehensions with multiple conditions and nested loops.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of list comprehensions.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the advanced list comprehensions in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program demonstrates how to use list comprehensions to generate lists based on different conditions and nested loops.
- It generates a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10.
- It generates a list of tuples (x, y) where x is even and y is odd, both from 1 to 5.
- It flattens a list of lists into a single list.

## Extensions
- Add more complex list comprehensions to solve different problems.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the conditions and loops for the list comprehensions.
