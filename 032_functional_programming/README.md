# Project Title: Functional Programming (Map, Filter, Reduce)

## Description
This project processes data using functional programming tools like map, filter, and reduce.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions in Python.
- Learn how to write lambda functions.
- Implement functional programming techniques.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of functional programming concepts.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create a file named `main.py`.
2.  Write the code for the functional programming in the file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `reduce` function from the `functools` module.
- It defines a function `functional_programming()` that demonstrates how to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- It uses `map` to square each number in a list.
- It uses `filter` to get even numbers from a list.
- It uses `reduce` to calculate the product of all numbers in a list.

## Extensions
- Add more functional programming techniques, such as currying or function composition.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the data and functions to use.
