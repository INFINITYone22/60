# Project Title: Multithreading with Threading

## Description
This project downloads files concurrently using threads.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `threading` module in Python.
- Learn how to create and start threads.
- Implement concurrent programming using threads.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of multithreading and the `threading` module.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Install the `requests` library using the command `pip install requests`.
5.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `threading`, `time`, and `requests` modules.
- It defines a function `download_file(url, filename)` that downloads a file from a URL using the `requests` library.
- It defines a function `main()` that creates multiple threads to download files concurrently.
- It creates a `Thread` object for each URL and starts the thread using `thread.start()`.
- It waits for all threads to complete using `thread.join()`.

## Extensions
- Add more error handling for network errors.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the URLs to be downloaded.
