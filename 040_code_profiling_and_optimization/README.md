# Project Title: Code Profiling and Optimization

## Description
This project profiles and optimizes a slow function.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `cProfile` module in Python.
- Learn how to profile code to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Implement optimization techniques to improve code performance.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of code profiling and optimization.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.
5.  Run the command `python -m pstats slow_function.prof` to view the profiling results for the slow function.
6.  Run the command `python -m pstats optimized_function.prof` to view the profiling results for the optimized function.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `time` and `cProfile` modules.
- It defines a slow function `slow_function()` that calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to 999999 using a loop.
- It defines an optimized function `optimized_function()` that calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to 999999 using the `sum()` function and `range()`.
- It uses `cProfile.run()` to profile the execution of both functions and save the results to `.prof` files.
- It prints instructions on how to view the profiling results using the `pstats` module.

## Extensions
- Add more complex functions to profile and optimize.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the functions to be profiled and optimized.
