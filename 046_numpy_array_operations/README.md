# Project Title: NumPy Array Operations

## Description
This project performs mathematical operations on NumPy arrays.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `numpy` module in Python.
- Learn how to create NumPy arrays.
- Perform mathematical operations on arrays.
- Reshape arrays.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of NumPy arrays.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Install the `numpy` library using the command `pip install numpy`.
5.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `numpy` module as `np`.
- It creates two NumPy arrays using `np.array()`.
- It performs element-wise addition and multiplication using the `+` and `*` operators.
- It calculates the mean of each array using `np.mean()`.
- It reshapes the first array using `arr1.reshape()`.

## Extensions
- Add more complex array operations, such as matrix multiplication or eigenvalue decomposition.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the arrays and operations to be performed.
