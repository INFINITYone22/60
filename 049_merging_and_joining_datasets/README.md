# Project Title: Merging and Joining Datasets

## Description
This project combines multiple datasets using Pandas.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use Pandas for merging and joining DataFrames.
- Learn how to use different types of merges and joins.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Pandas DataFrames.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Install the `pandas` library using the command `pip install pandas`.
5.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `pandas` module as `pd`.
- It creates two sample DataFrames with different data.
- It merges the DataFrames based on the 'ID' column using `pd.merge()`.
- It joins the DataFrames based on the index using `df1.join()`.

## Extensions
- Add more complex merging and joining scenarios.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the DataFrames and the merge/join criteria.
