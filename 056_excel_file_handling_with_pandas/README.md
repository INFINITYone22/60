# Project Title: Excel File Handling with Pandas

## Description
This project reads and writes Excel files using Pandas.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use Pandas to read and write Excel files.
- Learn how to create DataFrames from Excel data.
- Learn how to write DataFrames to Excel files.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Pandas DataFrames.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Install the `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries using the command `pip install pandas openpyxl`.
5.  Run the program using the command `python main.py`.

## Code Explanation
- The program imports the `pandas` module as `pd`.
- It creates a sample DataFrame.
- It writes the DataFrame to an Excel file using `df.to_excel()`.
- It reads the Excel file into a DataFrame using `pd.read_excel()`.

## Extensions
- Add more complex Excel file handling techniques, such as reading and writing multiple sheets or formatting data.
- Implement a GUI using Tkinter.
- Allow the user to specify the Excel file and the data to be used.
